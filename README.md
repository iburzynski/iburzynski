- 👋 Hi, I’m Ian, an instructor of functional programming and blockchain technology at EMURGO Academy and full-stack developer.
- ⚜️ Je préfère écrire en français.
- 🇵🇸 Je reste en Palestine et en Nouvelle-Angleterre (🤢)
- 👁️‍🗨️ I like (non-)philosophy, functional programming, and education. I program in Haskell, TypeScript and Python at the moment.
- 🌱 I’m currently exploring intuitionistic logic and Agda.
- 💞️ I’m looking to connect with other developers with a philosophical bent (bonus points for reading Laruelle or Negarestani).
- ✖️ Currently not open to offers of employment or projects. 
- 🐬 In the province of the mind there are no limits.
